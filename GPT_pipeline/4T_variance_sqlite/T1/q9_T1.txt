To answer this question, we need to first identify the non-healthy samples and then determine the most abundant species in those samples. Note that the `metadata` table contains information about the condition of the patient, which we can use to identify non-healthy samples. We can join the `abundance` and `metadata` tables on the `sample_id` field to access both the species count and metadata information. Here is the SQL query that addresses this question:;

6
SELECT species, SUM(count) AS total_abundance
FROM abundance
WHERE sample_id NOT IN (
    SELECT sample_id
    FROM metadata
    WHERE metadata_column_name = 'disease'
      AND metadata_variable_content = 'healthy'
)
GROUP BY species
ORDER BY total_abundance DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT a.species, SUM(a.count) AS total_count
FROM abundance AS a
JOIN metadata AS m ON a.sample_id = m.sample_id
WHERE m.metadata_column_name = 'disease'
  AND m.metadata_variable_content != 'healthy'
GROUP BY a.species
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

8
SELECT species, SUM(count) as total_abundance 
FROM abundance 
WHERE sample_id NOT IN (
  SELECT sample_id FROM metadata 
  WHERE metadata_column_name = 'disease' 
  AND metadata_variable_content = 'healthy')
GROUP BY species 
ORDER BY total_abundance DESC 
LIMIT 1;

9
SELECT species, SUM(count) as abundance
FROM abundance
WHERE sample_id NOT IN (
    SELECT sample_id
    FROM metadata
    WHERE metadata_column_name = 'disease'
      AND metadata_variable_content = 'healthy'
)
GROUP BY species
ORDER BY abundance DESC
LIMIT 10;

This query actually requires additional information about which metadata variable indicates whether a sample is "healthy" or "non-healthy". Assuming that the metadata column "disease" indicates the health status and "non-healthy" in this column corresponds to samples that are not healthy, here is the SQL query:

SELECT species, SUM(count) AS total_count
FROM abundance
WHERE sample_id IN (
        SELECT sample_id
        FROM metadata
        WHERE metadata_column_name = 'disease'
        AND metadata_variable_content != 'healthy'
)
GROUP BY species
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

This query selects the count of each species in all non-healthy samples in the metadata table, groups them by species name, and orders them in descending order by total count. It then limits the output to the top 10 most abundant species.;
